The game will feature a number of different Enemies. Most of which should be referencing something from another game/franchise/visualnovel. Pereferably more obscure ones, so some players might not even realize that enemies are references to something. However, enemy names should not match exactly to avoid my life being ruined by a lawsuit. This pages descibes the Enemy names, what they're a reference to and how they will behave.

**If no sprite is present, it can be assumed that the ability is not yet implemented.**
