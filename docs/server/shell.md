The Server Shell is a part of the Dedicated Server that can be optionally enabled and accessed using the MadBomberShell application. This Shell will open another Port to be used for the shell. This Port should **under no circumstances **be publicly exposed on the internet. The Shell Port is meant to be accessed from within the local network only.

| setversion | * Version String  <br>    _New Version string_                  | Very dangerous command, which will temporarily set the Client Version check to be valid for whatever Version String has been specified. Should probably be removed at some point. Meant to be used as a temporary workaround when using newer Versions of Clients that didn't require an update to the server. **Do not use this Command on any Server unless you know exactly what you're doing. **                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

It will not reload the contents of the maps and gametypes directories.<br><br>This is a bit of an experimental feature, as some of the Configuration parameters really shouldn't be changed while the server is running. You can however reconfigure your Map/GameType Rotation this way while people are connected the server. The rotation relevant Parameters are only used when the rotation is executed, so you could even reload during gameplay and nobody would notice. Next time the rotation executes your changes will be active. |
