**\***Be careful with TameRandomization settings, if your Server has any condition which requires selecting the same Map or GameType twice in a row, encountering these will cause the Server to crash. Only use if you're absolutely sure there will always be multiple valid Maps or GameTypes at any given time.

**\*\***Be aware that automatically downloading another version of a Map/GameType when a file with the same name is already present will cause the local file to be overwritten. Make sure you have any unsubmitted maps backed up whenever you use this feature.

**\*\*\***This setting is only used on public servers.
